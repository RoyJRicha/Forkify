# Forkify
Built this project from scratch as a part of learning JavaScript.

The Forkify application uses a local API which includes recipies for a number of different types of foods allowing the user to use the search bar to search for any type
of food they would like (as long as it is included in the API's database). In addition, the user can also bookmark/save recipies they like as well as create and save their
own recipies that they can create from scratch. All the data for this application is saved on local storage as it's not a large scale application that requires a larger
database to save information.

Summary:
Recipe search web application using an API (for recipes) - allows users to search for and save any recipes for food or drinks from over 1,000,000 recipes. Ability to add or bookmark their own recipes.
